This is an anaconda addon for configuring kdump. To use, there are
the following two possible approachs.

1.copy the com_redhat_kdump directory into /usr/share/anaconda/addons
on your installation media.

2.use the script makeimage in ./test to create updates.img

makeimage will create usr/share/anaconda/addons dir under ./test and
copy com_redhat_kdump dir to it then using cpio and gzip to create a
image in ./test.

upload will upload the image makeimage created to some remote HTTP or
FTP server. You should change the server to what you can access. 

After uploading the image to a remote server, add a boot parameter like
"linux updates=http://some.website.com/path/to/updates.img" to let the
anaconda download the image from that server while installation process.

3. use packbootiso.sh to repack Fedora boot.iso
Example:
packbootiso.sh boot.iso kdump-anaconda-addon-001.tar.gz
Above command will repack kdump addon into original boot.iso as boot-1.iso
